# Configure IBM Cloud Direct Link

Once your IBM Cloud Direct Link connectivity has been established, you can follow the steps given in this document to configure your subnet to interact with IBM Cloud.

In general, to get your IBM Cloud Direct Link connection working, you'll need to do some basic network configuration steps, and then you'll need to set up Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). During the setup process, an IBM engineer will work with you to enable your network to use Virtual Routing Function (VRF) capability, which is required.

## Basic Network Configuration

1. Define your remote network using the standard RFC1918 private address space. 
 * For new environments, it is recommended **not** to use the 10.0.0.0/8 space. 
 * For existing environments that utilize 10.0.0.0/8, we recommend that you obtain a more detailed assessment, to ensure that there is not a conflict with the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} services network, or with the networks already assigned to your account.

2. Our staff at {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} assigns a /31 or /30 for each connection and configures an interface IP address on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} cross-connect router (XCR) infrastructure.  

3. Configure the interface on your customer edge router (CER), using the IP address we've provided: just utilize the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} XCR IP as a next-hop for any traffic destined to {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}}. 

4. For return traffic, {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} utilizes the assigned CER IP as a next-hop for any traffic destined for the remote network, as advertised via BGP.

## Configuring BGP

To exchange route information with your environment, {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} requires BGP to be configured.  

1. **ASN**: {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} assigns a private ASN for each customer's use. Alternatively, you can utilize your own public ASN. Your preference is requested at the time you place your order. Your assigned private ASN is provided to you during the implementation process.

2. **VRF**: Using VRF, {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} advertises the specific private subnets assigned to your customer account.  You must advertise the remote networks that you wish to be reachable from the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} private network. The following networks are filtered out and can not be accepted: 0.0.0.0, 10.0.0.0/14, 10.198.0.0/15, 10.200.0.0/14, 169.254.0.0/16, 224.0.0.0/4. It is your responsbility as a customer to manage the advertisements to and from the IBM Cloud network. (More details about VRF are included in the next section.)

3. **ECMP**: For customers who elect to build redundancy at a supported location, {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} supports the implementation of equal-cost multipath (ECMP) to provide load balancing and redundancy across the two links. This ECMP setup should be requested at the time of order.

## BGP specifications for IBM Cloud Direct Link 

The BGP specifications are as follows:

As stated in the preceding section, BGP is mandatory for managing your routing through Direct Link. An account that orders Direct Link will be migrated to VRF environment.

**Caveats for VLANS and VRF:**
 * Inter-account VLAN spanning is not allowed in the VRF environment. 
 * IPSEC VPN service is limited. 
 
**Note:** VRF does not prevent SSL or PPTP VPN access, but its behavior changes. Without VRF, one VPN connection is enough to see all servers on your account. With VRF, you can only access resources in the market associated with your VPN. So if you connect to the DAL VPN, you can only connect to DAL servers.

IBM Cloud ASN is **13884**, for Public and Private services. 
 * The default ASN for a customer when ordering is **64999**, but the default can be changed by customer request. 
 * Optionally, a 4-byte Private ASN between 4201000000 and 4201064511 can be supported.
 * If you're using Direct Link Connect with a layer-3 service, such as IP VPN, IBM Cloud will establish BGP with the Direct Link Connect provider's ASN
   
**Strict limitations on IP assignments:**
 * If you utilize the 10.x.x.x network, you still cannot create overlap with your hosts within IBM Cloud nor with the IBM Cloud services network, which occupies `10.0.0.0/14`, `10.198.0.0/15`, and `10.200.0.0/14`.  

 * The following ranges are not allowed in the Federal system and they will be rejected by IBM servers: `169.254.0.0/16`, `224.0.0.0/4`.

**Recommendations, Defaults, and Limits:**

 * Tunneling (that is, GRE) is supported and recommended if IP overlap becomes an issue.
 * BGP timer defaults are `Keepalive:30`, `Holdtime:60.`
 * Authentication is not enabled by default.
 * BGP BFD is not enabled by default.
 * Maximum received (from Customer or provider) prefix limit is 200 per VRF.

## Redundancy and Diversity

IBM Cloud Direct Link provides diversity, and customers are responsible for implementing redundancy through their BGP schemas.

If you select ECMP for redundancy, both BGP sessions have to exist on the same XCR, therefore you give up router diversity and are exposed to risk if the router should fail. You gain Layer-3 redundancy but you lose router diversity.

## More about using VRF

All accounts that utilize an IBM Cloud Direct Link solution must migrate to a VRF. By using VRF, customers advertise the available routes to their self-defined remote networks. Note that this configuration does not permit you to utilize self-defined IP addresses on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} network.

Migrating to a VRF is done during the setup process. It requires a short outage window (up to 30 minutes for large accounts with multiple VLANs/locations), during which the backend network VLANs will lose mutual connectivity while they are moved to the VRF. The VRF migration is scheduled with the implementing engineer.

Please note that VRF eliminates the "VLAN Spanning" option for your account, including any account-to-account VLAN spanning capabilities, because all VLANs are able to communicate unless a Gateway Appliance is introduced to manage traffic. VRF also limits the ability to use {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} VPN services, because it is not compatible with {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} SSL, PPTP, and IPSec VPN services.   

An alternative is to use the IBM Cloud Direct Link offering itself to manage your servers, or to run your own VPN solution (such as a Vyatta) that can be configured with different types of VPN. After migrating to a VRF, SSL VPN typically works when a VPN connection is made to the same data center location in which a compute VM is running, but it does not allow access globally.

## Using BYOIP and NAT with Direct Link
IBM Cloud Direct Link does not offer BYOIP on the private network, except in special circumstances covered under the section on [Custom Private Addressing](#about-custom-private-addressing). Therefore, traffic with a destination IP address that was not assigned by {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} will be dropped. However, customers can encapsulate traffic between the remote network and their {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} network using GRE, IPSec, or VXLAN.  

Most commonly, the BYOIP environment is implemented within the scope of either a Network Gateway (Vyatta) or a VMWare NSX deployment. This configuration enables customers to use any desirable IP space on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} side, and to route back across the tunnel to the remote network. Note that this configuration must be managed and supported by the customer, independent of {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}}. Furthermore, this configuration can break connectivity to the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} services network if the customer assigns a 10.x.x.x block that {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} has in use for services. 

This solution also requires that each host needing connectivity to the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} services network and the remote network must have 2 IP addresses assigned: one must be assigned from the IBM 10.x.x.x block, and one from the remote network block. Static routes must be set up on the host, to ensure that traffic is routed appropriately. You will not be able to assign IP space directly on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} hosts (BYOIP) and have it routable on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} network inherently. The only way to implement this ability is as outlined previously, but it is not supported by {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}}.

Alternatively, customers frequently assign a remote network block for use in a NAT table configured on their remote edge router. This configuration allows customers to limit the changes required to both networks, while still translating traffic into a network address space that is compatible with both networks.
